# 🏠 Home Services Marketplace – React Native MVP

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **mobile MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** for a home services marketplace, developed as part of a technical test with a **48-hour time constraint**.

The application allows users located in **Casablanca** to request a home service, upload a photo, receive a simulated AI diagnostic, compare service provider quotes, schedule a visit, confirm a cash payment, and rate the service.

The objective of this project is **not** to build a full production application, but to demonstrate:
- Product thinking
- Clean and readable code
- Proper component and state management
- Clear data flow
- Ability to prioritize features under time constraints

---

## 🎯 Supported Services
The platform operates in **Casablanca only** and supports the following service categories:
- Plumbing
- Electricity
- Cleaning

---

## 👤 User Flow
The app follows a simple and linear user journey:

1. Select a service category  
2. Describe the issue and upload a photo  
3. Receive a simulated AI diagnostic  
4. Compare available service provider quotes  
5. Schedule a visit (date & time)  
6. Confirm payment (cash only)  
7. Rate the service after completion  

Each screen represents one clear step in the process.

## 🤖 AI Diagnostic (Mocked)
The AI diagnostic feature is **intentionally simulated**.

### How it works:
- Uses simple rule-based logic depending on the selected service category
- Returns a diagnostic result (issue, urgency, recommendation)
- No real AI model or external API is used

### Reasoning:
- Keeps the MVP focused and lightweight
- Demonstrates how AI could be integrated into the flow
- The logic is isolated and can easily be replaced with a real AI API in the future

---

## 🧱 Technical Stack
- **React Native (Expo)**
- **TypeScript**
- **React Navigation (Stack)**
- **Context API** for state management
- **Expo Image Picker** for photo upload

## 🗂️ Project Structure
The project follows a clean and modular architecture:

src/
├─ navigation/ # App navigation
├─ screens/ # App screens (one per step)
├─ components/ # Reusable UI components
├─ context/ # Global state management
├─ services/ # Mocked business logic (AI, quotes)
├─ models/ # TypeScript data models
├─ utils/ # Constants and helpers


This structure improves readability, scalability, and maintainability.

---

## 🧠 State Management
The **Context API** is used to manage the full lifecycle of a service request, including:
- Selected service category
- Issue description and image
- AI diagnostic result
- Selected provider quote
- Scheduled date and time
- Payment confirmation
- Service rating

This approach avoids prop drilling and keeps the data consistent across screens.

---

## 🚫 Limitations & Assumptions
Due to the limited time frame, the following features were intentionally left out:
- Backend API integration
- User authentication
- Data persistence
- Real payment gateway
- Real AI model integration
- Notifications

All data is handled in-memory using mocked services.

---

## 🚀 Possible Improvements
With more time, the following improvements could be implemented:
- Backend and database integration
- Authentication and user profiles
- Real AI diagnostic service
- Online payment methods
- Service provider availability management
- Multi-city support
